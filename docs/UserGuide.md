## How to Get Started

#### 1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

#### 2. Download the latest `advisio.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

#### 3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

#### 4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the

#### 5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe`
  to the Address Book.

* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

* `undo` : Undo the previous command `delete 3`. Thus original 3rd contact shown in list will come back

* `redo` : Redo the previous command `delete 3`. Thus 3rd contact will be deleted again from list

* `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

* `exit` : Exits the app.

#### 6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Some notes about the command format**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: My computer doesn't have Java 11 installed, what should I do?<br>
**A**: You can install Java 11 from [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html). All you have to do now is find your operating systems and follow the steps given! Alternatively, you can also install Java 11 from [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org). 

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection use Advisio?<br>
**A**: Advisio is a local application that does not require an internet connection! Feel free to use our application anywhere and anytime as you see fit!

**Q**: Is my data stored on the cloud? How can I ensure that I do not lose such critical information?<br>
**A**:Unfortunately, Advisio does not  support cloud support. However, you can follow these steps to store your data safely in existing cloud services such as Icloud or Google Drive. Firstly, locate the data file `<JAR file location>/data/clientbook.json`. Secondly, copy the file into your preferred cloud service. 

**Q**: I would like to add a new policy, however the application doesn't allow me to add a policy other than those that are supported by the application. What should I do?<br>
**A**: We restricted the policies to a limited few for the convenience of Financial Advisors so that they wouldn't find themselves in a situation where they can't remember the policy that was added. The engineering team for your company should be able to add a new general policy if it's required.

**Q**: Is there a limit to the number of clients or policies that I can add?<br>
**A**: There is approximately a 2 million limit for both clients and policies separately. We have analysed and interviewed verteran Financial Adivsors and have concluded that it is very unlikely for a Financial Advisor to to exceed those thresholds. However, the limit can be expanded in the future if necessary.
